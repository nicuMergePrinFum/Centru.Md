To make it work, in 4 Easy steps.
1. Unzip Cakephp 1.3.4, http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/zipball/1.3.4 and put the cake folder to cake/, the folder structure should be

|- app
  |- controllers
  |- views
  |- models
  |- tmp 	<- make this writable for www user daemon (3)
  |- webroot 	<- DocumentRoot should be pointed here (4)
  |- ..
|- cake
  |- libs
  |- ..

(2) UNIX only. Not needed on Windows.
2.1 To make a directory writable for all users (www user inclusive), you need to use the chmod command.
We want to make all directories inside app/tmp writable, so the -R (recursive) will be used.
You need to run.
chmod -R a+w app/tmp
a mean all, +w mean make app/tmp writable for all users.
[2.2] Another way is to make the owner of the app/tmp the www deamon.
You need to know the user name of the www deamon. 
If you use apache, execute: ps -eo user,comm | grep apache or ps aux | grep apache
The user name should be the first column.
After you have the user name, with the root rights do chown -R www_user:www_user app/tmp

(3) For apache only.
For comodity, add to the /etc/hosts "127.0.0.1 centru.local www.centru.local"

<VirtualHost *>
        ServerAdmin support@centru.local
        ServerName  www.centru.local
        ServerAlias centru.local

        # Indexes + Directory Root.
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        # Replace ... with full path to the app
        DocumentRoot .../app/webroot/

        # Logfiles
        ErrorLog  /var/log/apache2/centru.local_error.log
        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/centru.local_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

Now after do apache2ctl graceful
